# c\#, explain events and delegates like i am 5 years old, use examples (code snippets) to make it even easier to understand

Events and delegates in C\# can be explained simply using everyday examples and easy code snippets.

### What is a Delegate?

A delegate is like a **remote control** that can point to or "call" a specific action (method). Imagine you have a TV remote, and pressing a button on it makes the TV volume go up. The remote knows how to call the "Increase Volume" action, but it doesn't care which TV it controls or where it is.

In C\# code, a delegate looks like this:

```csharp
// Define a delegate (remote control)
public delegate void RemoteControl();

// Method that performs an action (volume up)
public void IncreaseVolume()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Volume is increased!");
}

// Assign method to delegate and call it
RemoteControl remote = IncreaseVolume;
remote();  // Pressing the remote button calls IncreaseVolume
```

Here, `RemoteControl` is the delegate (the remote), and `IncreaseVolume` is the method called by the remote. Calling `remote()` makes the volume go up [^1].

### What is an Event?

An event is like a **fire alarm system** that alerts different people when something happens. When the alarm rings (event happens), many listeners can do their own jobs - like people evacuating or calling firefighters. The event notifies everyone who signed up to listen.

In C\# code, an event might look like this:

```csharp
// Define a delegate for the alarm
public delegate void AlarmHandler();

// Declare an event using the delegate
public event AlarmHandler FireAlarm;

// Method to trigger the alarm
public void DetectFire()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Fire detected!");
    FireAlarm?.Invoke();  // Notify everyone who listens
}

// Methods responding to the alarm
public void CallFireDepartment()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Calling fire department...");
}

public void EvacuateBuilding()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Evacuating building...");
}

// Subscribing to the event
FireAlarm += CallFireDepartment;
FireAlarm += EvacuateBuilding;

// Trigger the event
DetectFire();
```

When `DetectFire()` is called, the `FireAlarm` event notifies all subscribers, so both `CallFireDepartment()` and `EvacuateBuilding()` run, just like a real fire alarm alerting many people [^1].

### Summary

- A **delegate** is like a remote control that "points" to a method you want to call.
- An **event** is a system that lets multiple parts of your program know when something important happens (like a fire alarm).
- You define a delegate as a method type, then create an event based on it.
- Other parts can subscribe (listen) to this event, and when the event is triggered, all subscribers get notified and act accordingly.

This way of programming helps your code be flexible and interactive, especially in programs with user actions or system notifications [^1].
