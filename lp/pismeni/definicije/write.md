- `write` outputs data to a line buffer (`line` type) without adding a newline character at the end. It just appends the data to the current line.
- `writeline` outputs the entire content of the line buffer to the target file or output and then **appends a newline character** (line feed) automatically, moving the cursor to the next line for subsequent outputs.

In your example:

```vhdl
write(current_wline, string'("Input=ABCD, Output=F"));
writeline(Fout, current_wline);
```

`write` adds the string to the variable `current_wline` (a `line` type), and then `writeline` writes this line to the output file `Fout` and moves to the next line for the next write operation. Without `writeline`, you would manually have to add newline characters if you want multi-line output.

Summary:

- Use `write` to build or append data on the current line.
- Use `writeline` to finalize and output the current line with a newline.

This is consistent with how these functions help manage text output in VHDL simulation or file I/O.
